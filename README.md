The resultant research paper relating to this project can be found <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AuvGir3UpjEugbEaGIcweYsKA2JaWw" target="_blank">here.</a>




The software artefact comprises multiple components, namely:
- A mobile application.
- A website, serving as an administrative interface for lecturers.
- A back-end database for student timetabling and credential verification.
- A QR-Code generator that creates unique QRs which are active for a finite duration (10 seconds).

The final system offers addtional safety features such as encryption & 2 factor-authentication. This repository contains the code for the QuickR Android Mobile Application, Developed in Android Studio using Kotlin. CodeScanner Author: yuriy-budiyev - https://github.com/yuriy-budiyev/code-scanner
